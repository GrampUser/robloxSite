            <p>
              At Blocky Rewards, we do not ask for or require any personal
              information. You complete offers on the website and earn currency
              in which you can withdraw to your account. For every offer
              completed, our partners pay us, and in turn, we invest a portion
              of that money back into currency for payouts to give back to you,
              creating a fair and win-win situation for both parties.
